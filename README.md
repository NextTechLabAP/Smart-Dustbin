# Smart-Dustbin
Usually dustbins require to be opened by pressing foot against its lever and then throwing waste in it, but ours is a Smart Dustbin which is controlled by a telegram bot, which approaches the user when called and it will return to its original spot on its own when the job is done. And also it detects if the waste is recyclable or not and opens respective comparments for the same.
